# getTextData
Code that gets certain data from text written during Genesys Internship using pure javascript.
There are two forms: the one that was written using regex and another one.
This text contains names, emails and numbers.

## USAGE
# For usingRegEx and usingregExmodified files:
1. change the contents of the text variable to that of the text you want to get data from.
2. ensure that the email address is inside angle brackets and the numbers start with '+'.
3. also remember to write each dataset on a newline.
4. invoke function emails(text) to get the emails.
5. invoke function nums(text) to get the numbers.
6. invoke function names(text) to get the two names.

# For advancedRegEx
This contains codes that:
1. validates an HTML hex color
2. gets names from a string
3. converts a url to a link.
Use the above format to test it out. Feel free to change the text and data variables.
